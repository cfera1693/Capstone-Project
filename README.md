# Capstone-Project

Final Project for my master's degree, dedicated to study consumer values dynamics with our client RPA. We construct a BERT model to predict Amazon reviews on the values that consumers are pursuing. These values were kindly provided by RPA according to their marketing needs. 

The values are the following: 

- Social Connectedness
- Environment
- Self-Sufficiency
- Transparency/Authenticity
- Tradition
- Individuality
- Diversity/Equality
- Privacy
- Status
- Thrift/Value
- Innovation
- Fun/Adventure
- Health
